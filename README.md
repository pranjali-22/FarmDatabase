# CPSC 304 - Project
#### Summary 
The project is based on the database management of an agricultural firm. The model can be
used by agricultural companies for farm and farmer management, crop production and crop
distribution.

#### Application
The application models the farming management aspects of the agricultural firm. In real life, this model can be used by a firm which owns multiple farms, assigns multiple farmers work on these farms, produces different varieties of crops and sells the produced crops through different channels. Such an agricultural firm will
need to keep track of the location, soil type and area of each owned farm, type and quantity of each crop produced by each farm and the contact and personal
details of the farmers working on the farms, details of the supervisors monitoring the farms. The company will also need to keep track of the budget needed for
each farm and the farming tools needed by each farm. The management of such companies will require an application model to keep a record of all the operations which is addressed by this application model.
